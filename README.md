# Remote Command Execution System

A lightweight and extensible Java 21 system for executing remote commands across distributed machines, designed for scalability, security, and ease of integration. This application is built using Java Servlets.

## Features

- **Remote Command Execution**: Securely execute shell commands on remote hosts.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Supports user authentication and command permission management.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new command modules or integrations.
- **Logging & Auditing**: Tracks command history and user actions for auditing purposes.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting for failed commands and connectivity issues.

## Technology Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Servlet API**
- **Maven** (for build and dependency management)
- **(Optional) Tomcat or Jetty** for deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 installed
- Maven installed
- Servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Jetty)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LithiraJK/remote-command-execution-system.git
cd remote-command-execution-system
```

Build the project using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Deployment

1. Deploy the generated `.war` file from `target/` to your servlet container (e.g., Tomcat or Jetty).
2. Configure your servlet container as needed (see container documentation).

### Configuration

- Edit the configuration file (`config.properties` or similar) to set up hosts, authentication methods, and permissions.

### Usage

- Access the web application via your servlet containerâ€™s configured URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/remote-command-execution-system`).
- Use the web interface to authenticate and send remote commands.
- Alternatively, interact via API endpoints exposed by the servlet (see API documentation if available).

## Architecture

- **Servlet-based Server**: Handles HTTP requests, authentication, command dispatch, and response formatting.
- **Client**: Uses HTTP to interact with the server; can be a browser or HTTP client.
- **Authentication Layer**: Verifies user credentials before command execution.
- **Logging Module**: Records actions and command results.

## Security

- Encrypted communication (recommend deploying behind HTTPS).
- Role-based access control for command execution.
- Auditable logs for all operations.
